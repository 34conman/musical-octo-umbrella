# X-Team 45 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
We will divide work evenly.


## How we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
We will track progress using Git. We will also text each other to follow up on the completion of tasks if somebody isn't doing what's assigned to them.


## How we will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We will text each other or hold a meeting if we have difficulties with a task assignued to us.
We will not be scared to confront each other to ask for help or raise concerns about our project, we are a team now.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Keep up continuous communication through our group chat making sure that we complete our tasks in a timely manner. We will try our best to make sure everyone's schedules are taken into account for group meetings.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Be accountable for your work and to the team.
Show up on time.
Bring a laptop to meetings.
Let team members know if you cannot make a meeting.
Meet deadlines for tasks. If you cannot meet deadlines notify team members.
